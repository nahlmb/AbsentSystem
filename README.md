# AbsentSystem
بِسْمِ اللّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيْمِ , school attendance system with android application, 😊

attendance? ... it's like small but very important, especially in boarding school, because the attendance list, the students is excited to attend ...
but the absence of attendance is generally very complicated ... where the teacher must shout, spend a lot of paper, etc.
AbsentSystem or absenIDN (this app use this name when i sumbit it to the school competition) is an application that I developed when I joined the individual hackathon competition at school, this application records absences with barcodes, where the teacher does not need to manually record but only scans the barcode on the student card ..
the teacher can also see the results of attendance

I allow this source code to be seen and edited by anyone who wants to learn from it,
especially my friends and my classmates, and all Muslim programmers, because we are brothers,

of course this small project is nothing compared to the others,
but I hope it can be useful for many people,

You can take the absen_idn file in the api support folder and place it at htdocs,
